# [appreciate whitepaper](https://github.com/Appreciate-Stuff/appreciate-whitepaper/blob/master/appreciate_white_paper.pdf)


appreciate is building an infrastructure that enables utility for digital ownership. In this whitepaper, our team outlines the use of a cryptogram, service registry, provisioner, and delegator to create a technical architecture that supports Proof of Purchase and Proof of Ownership. Through the ingestion and calculation of data points pertaining to availability, integrity, and confidentiality, appreciate determines a probability score, known as the McEntire Score, to prove Proof of Ownership.

By established Proof of Ownership for a person and their item, item based utility expands beyond the scope of physical use. Items can be leveraged in new ways, including owner-to-owner marketplaces, item tracking as a service, service loyalty and rewards, tokenization, and dynamic NFTs. 

The appreciate team and its technology is turning infrastructures into ecosystems, items into assets, consumers into owners.
